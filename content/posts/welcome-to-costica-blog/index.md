# Hi :wave: :wave: :wave:

You've stumbled upon my blog! How wonderful! _Welcome!_

I'm Costin, but people that do know me call me, at least sometimes, "Costica". 

This is an opinionated blog with some tech tutorials, random bumblings, some ranting, some... who knows.

But, just for extra safety: **_Opinions expressed are solely my own and do not express the views or opinions of my employer._**

&nbsp;

# Why this blog
&nbsp;

### Because sharing is caring :gift:
As I've learned from tons of articles, books, videos, etc... I think it's time to give a little back and share: 
* _what_ I think it's important
* _how_ I learn(ed) new things
* _why_ I chose to focus on some parts of the tech world more than others

### Because it helps me grow :books:
> “If you want to learn something, read about it. If you want to understand something, write about it. If you want to master something, teach it.”

### Because I keep forgetting things :chart_with_downwards_trend:
I've had multiple projects and experiments that got lost in the sands of time. 

So I plan to use this blog as an "archive" of experiments, hopefully better documented as they will be exposed to a larger-than-myself audience

### Because I like writing :innocent:
That's it, simple as that. Helps me clear my mind. Now go away.

### Because I'm scared of it :scream:
What if, god forbid, I have the wrong understanding on some subject? What if someone calls me out and says that I'm wrong about something?

What if I miss something and expose some personal `apiKey` or secrets? 

### Because I've been "forced" to :muscle:
Won't name the person without consent, but I've been advised to start exactly this kind of blog. 

While it was on my mind for a while now, I think it helped quite a lot that I got strong advice to do this... so, here we are.

# Bye 
Ok, long enough to not be a clickbait, long enough to make me feel better because I explained myself and `why` I'm doing this... 

Good enough then. By-bye!
