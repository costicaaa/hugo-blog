# About me

I'm a Software Engineer with several years of experience in turning chaotic
requirements into apps. Proficient in areas ranging from Backend, Frontend,
DevOps, Testing, all the way to Cloud and Distributed Systems.

Always looking to learn new things. I enjoy automating repetitive tasks and figuring out solutions by balancing trade-offs given time & budget constraints. 

Main skill-set: Cloud | Distributed Systems | Microservices | Event-Driven Architecture | Domain Driven Design | AWS (Lambda, S3, RDS, EC2, etc) | Kubernetes | Docker | CI/CD | Jenkins | Linux | Node.js | Javascript | Vue | Angular | React | PHP | Laravel | GraphQL | MySQL | PostgreSQL | NoSQL | Git | HTML

Tinkered with: WebSockets | Typescript | Firebase | Redis | MongoDB |  Solidity | Go | Typescript | Consumer-Driven Contract Testing | Apache | Nginx | Haproxy | Terraform | Splunk | New Relic 

Willing to learn: anything (except CSS). 

Currently working as a Tech Lead & Software Engineer for Adobe.
